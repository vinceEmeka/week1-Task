The Significance of the meta charset utf-8

The charset attribute specifies the character encoding for the HTML document.

As a result, the web page can display text in multiple languages and special characters correctly. 

Without this declaration, the text would not be properly encoded, leading to rendering issues.

The HTML5 specification encourages web developers to use the UTF-8 character set, which covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world!
